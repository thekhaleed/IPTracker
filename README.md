## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap


### What I learned
- I learned about the geo-ipify API and how to use it. 
- It was also my first time adding a map to a website and that was a great learning experience too. 
- I also got clarity that you don't always have to use the frameworks eg: React JS.
- I also handled errors and displayed them which was extra work because it was not specified.


### Continued development

- I want to get better at handling API calls with JS. I feel I am not yet comfortable with it.
- I also want to explore more of geo-ipify and use it in my developement. 

### Useful resources
- Not a resource per say but incase the map you are trying to show is not loading, try making sure you have not hidden the overflow. This was the biggest challenge.
